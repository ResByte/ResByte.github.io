        <p>About Me <br>
        <p> I previously worked with Rapyuta Robotics as Robot Navigation Intern. Before this I completed Master course in Information Science from <a href="http://www.naist.jp/en/">NAIST</a> with thesis in Robotics and Machine Learning. I did my undergraduate in Electrical Engineering from <a href="http://www.iitj.ac.in">IITJ</a>.  </p>

        <h1>Publications </h1>
        <h3>In Proceedings of International Conference</h3>
        <p>Abhinav Dadhich, Nishanth Koganti, and Tomohiro Shibata.
        <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2783510">"Modeling occupancy grids using EDHMM for dynamic environments."</a>,In Proceedings of the Conference on Advances In Robotics <b>2015</b>, p. 60. ACM, 2015.</p>

        <h1>Projects</h1>
      <h3>1. SLAM backend for cloud based mapping</h3>
      <p>Real-time mapping is still a challenge for a lot of mobile robots, as available computation power is very limited and also to avoid network overflow from rgbd data, it is necessary to rethink algorithms. In this project, a keyframe-graph based map is created and a metric distance based loop closure detection is applied. Further, the constructed graph is is optimized using g2o on regualar intervals to minimize the error cost. This is implemented in ROS using pcl, opencv and g2o. It is further fine tuned to perform on multi-core cpu.</p>

			<h3>2. 3D Mapping of Indoor Environments</h3>
			During Master Course, I played around a lot with RGBD sensors. In this project, I created 3D map of the environment from turtlebot robot. I used RBPF localization with occupancy grids to generate 3D Octomaps. The accuracy of this was limited to non-cluttered envirnonments like hallways. As can be seen from the figure.

			<h3>3. Iterative Closest Point Matching using PCL </h3>
	        <p>ICP is one of the common algorithms used to register 2 pointclouds. This outputs a transformation of second cloud wrt first. Often this is used to calculate visual odometry in Visual-slam. <a href="https://github.com/ResByte/3D-mapping/tree/master/Pose_Graph/ICP-Test">Here</a> is an implementation using PCL in ROS.</p>

	        <h3>How to Rice Ubuntu.</h3>
	        <p>
	        While ubuntu is very good environment for development, it can also be tweaked around for user satisfaction. If you are not interested in Unity and other Gnome desktop managers, this is for you. i3wm is one of the lighweight windows manager and can be tweaked around a lot. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4">This</a> is one of the simplest tutorial to get the feel of what I am saying.
