<p>Hello World ! <br>

<h3> Education </h3>
<p>I am research based Master Course student in Information Science at Nara Institute of Science and Technology(NAIST), Japan. <br>
I have experience of projects in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Robotics.  
</p>
<h3> Research </h3>
<p>My master's research broadly lies under robot navigation and learning.<br>
During robot navigation in real world for long periods of working such as months, the area around the robot is changing. These changes causes error in continious localization.The proposed model provides robot inference about objects that that change their position.<br></p>
<p> To get full list of projects and experience, please refer to my Resume or mail me at linkedin. </p>
