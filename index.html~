<p>Hello World ! <br>
<h3> Education </h3>
I am research based Master Course student in Information Science at Nara Institute of Science and Technology(NAIST), Japan. <br>
I have experience of projects in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Robotics. .   
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3> Research </h3>
<p>My master's research broadly lies under robot navigation and learning.<br>
During robot navigation in real world for long periods of working such as months,<br> 
the area around the robot is changing. These changes causes error in continious localization.<br>
The proposed model provides robot inference <br>
about objects that that change their position.<br>
To get full list of projects and experience, please refer to my Resume. </p>

<p>I like to Read, Code and Discuss. </p>
