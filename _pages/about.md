I am currently working at [Abeja](http://www.abeja.asia) as Deep Learning Researcher. I am interested in Applied Deep Learning  especially.  
Most frequent tools used are : Pytorch, Keras, Tensorflow, Nvidia-Docker, Opencv, Scikit-Learn

Following are a few of the various themes I have worked on:
- GAN and AutoEncoders based Generative Modelling. 
- Bayesian Deep Learning for Unsupervised Learning. 
- Activity Recognition from Videos.
- Benchmarking libraries such as mxnet, tensorflow etc.
- Human Pose Estimation from image.
- Image classification using deep neural nets with pre-trained as well as from scratch.
- Object Detection using SSD, Yolo, Faster-RCNN.
- 3D Dense Slam using Depth sensor.

## Book 

### Practical Computer Vision
In this book, you will find several recently proposed methods in various domains of computer vision. You will start by setting up the proper Python environment to work on practical applications. This includes setting up libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras using Anaconda. Using these libraries, you'll start to understand the concepts of image transformation and filtering. You will find a detailed explanation of feature detectors such as FAST and ORB; you'll use them to find similar-looking objects.

With an introduction to convolutional neural nets, you will learn how to build a deep neural net using Keras and how to use it to classify the Fashion-MNIST dataset. With regard to object detection, you will learn the implementation of a simple face detector as well as the workings of complex deep-learning-based object detectors such as Faster R-CNN and SSD using TensorFlow. You'll get started with semantic segmentation using FCN models and track objects with Deep SORT. Not only this, you will also use Visual SLAM techniques such as ORB-SLAM on a standard dataset.

By the end of this book, you will have a firm understanding of the different computer vision techniques and how to apply them in your applications.
