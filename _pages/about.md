I am currently working at [Abeja](http://www.abeja.asia) as Deep Learning Researcher. I am interested in Applied Deep Learning as well as Generative Modelling. 
Following are few of the various projects I have worked on:

- Image classification using deep neural nets. 
- Fine tuning pre-trained network.
- Task based feature learning.
- Modelling deep neural nets from scratch.
- Benchmarking libraries such as mxnet, tensorflow etc.

## Programming and Tools

C++ | Python| Keras | Tensorflow | Mxnet | Scikit-learn | OpenCV | ROS 


## Education
          
I completed Master course in Information Science from [NAIST](http://www.naist.jp/en/) with thesis in Robotics and Machine Learning.I did my undergraduate in Electrical Engineering from [IITJ](http://www.iitj.ac.in).
