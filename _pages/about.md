I am currently working at [Abeja](http://www.abeja.asia) as Deep Learning Researcher. I am interested in Applied Deep Learning as well as Adversarial Models. 
Following are few of the various projects I have worked on:

- Image classification using deep neural nets. 
- Fine tuning a pre-trained network.
- Feature learning from images.
- Modelling deep neural nets from scratch.
- Benchmarking libraries such as mxnet, tensorflow etc.
