I am currently working at [Abeja](http://www.abeja.asia) as Deep Learning Researcher. I am interested in Applied Deep Learning as well as Adversarial Models. With experience in data cleansing and data preprocessing, I develop several ML and CV applications to enhance business operations and provide an edge over competitors.  
Most frequent tools used are : Pytorch, Keras, Tensorflow, Nvidia-Docker, Opencv, Scikit-Learn

Following are a few of the various projects I have worked on:

- Image classification using deep neural nets. 
- Fine tuning a pre-trained network.
- Feature learning from images.
- Modelling deep neural nets from scratch.
- Benchmarking libraries such as mxnet, tensorflow etc.
