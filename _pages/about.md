I am currently working at [Abeja](http://www.abeja.asia) as Deep Learning Researcher. I am interested in Applied Deep Learning  especially unsupervised learning as well as representation learning.  
Most frequent tools used are : Pytorch, Keras, Tensorflow, Nvidia-Docker, Opencv, Scikit-Learn

Following are a few of the various themes I have worked on:
- Image classification using deep neural nets with pre-trained as well as from scratch. 
- Object Detection using SSD, Yolo, Faster-RCNN. 
- Unsupervised representation learning for images. 
- Benchmarking libraries such as mxnet, tensorflow etc.
- Human Pose Estimation from image.
- 3D Dense Slam using Depth sensor. 
- Robot Navigation for Long term Deployments
